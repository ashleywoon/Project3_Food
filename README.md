# Project3_Food
####by Ashley Woon
###This is an alternative version without the potentiometer, instead using keys as my potentiometer has stopped working

###To interact with this project, use the keys 'c' and 'f' to make a meal selection. 
###Press 'c' for chicken or 'f' for fish. After choosing a meal push the button once to confirm and watch it cook. 
###Press the button a second time and the door will open and you've taken out your food. 
###Press one more time to close the door and you're done! This device works like a real microwave in that it must be reset (the program restarted) to be used again.

###This github for my Project 3 is categorized as 3 components. 

##  1) The source files:
There is an individual folder associated with the Processing sketch and related pde file just as there is an individual folder for the Arduino sketch.

##  2) The design documentation
There is pdf titled design document, a license, and a README.md file to explain this repository.

##  3) Video and hardware
There are 3 mp4 files showcasing the Processing sketch and the hardware in action. One is showing the code, one is of the fish state, one is of the chicken state.
